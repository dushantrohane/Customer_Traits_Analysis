# Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Pipeline

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Data Analytics workflow**, starting from raw data ingestion to interactive business insights through a Power BI dashboard. The goal is to showcase practical skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, and data visualization in a recruiter-friendly and industry-relevant manner.

The project follows a structured analytics pipeline:

* Load and explore data using Python
* Clean and prepare data for analysis
* Perform analytical queries using PostgreSQL
* Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for insights

---

## Dataset

* **Source:** Kaggle (public dataset)
* **Type:** Structured, tabular data
* **Description:** The dataset contains customer-related attributes used to analyze patterns, trends, and key performance indicators.

> Note: The dataset was first explored and cleaned in Python before being stored and queried in PostgreSQL.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python:** Data loading, EDA, and data cleaning

  * Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive analysis and documentation
* **PostgreSQL:** Data storage and SQL-based analysis
* **SQL:** Data extraction, aggregation, and filtering
* **Power BI:** Data visualization and dashboard creation

## Project Workflow / Steps

### 1. Data Loading (Python)

* Imported the dataset into Jupyter Notebook
* Reviewed data structure, column names, and data types

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Checked data distributions and summary statistics
* Identified missing values, duplicates, and outliers
* Performed basic visual analysis to understand patterns

### 3. Data Cleaning

* Handled missing and inconsistent values
* Removed duplicates where necessary
* Standardized column formats for analysis

### 4. PostgreSQL Integration

* Loaded the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL Server
* Designed tables with appropriate data types
* Verified data integrity after loading

### 5. SQL Analysis

* Wrote SQL queries to:

  * Filter and segment data
  * Perform aggregations and calculations
  * Answer business-oriented analytical questions

### 6. Power BI Dashboard

* Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL
* Built interactive visuals such as:

  * KPIs
  * Bar charts and pie charts
  * Filters and slicers for dynamic analysis
* Designed the dashboard with a clean and professional layout

---

## Dashboard Highlights

* Clear KPIs for quick insights
* Interactive filters for deeper exploration
* Business-focused visuals for decision-making
* Optimized color theme and layout for readability

---

## Key Results & Insights

* Identified meaningful patterns and trends in customer data
* Converted raw data into actionable insights
* Demonstrated ability to connect analysis with visualization
* Delivered a complete analytics solution from data to dashboard
